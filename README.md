# Path Finding Visualiser

Visualization is a powerful tool for understanding any subject more quickly than traditional approaches. 
This project aims to develop a web-based application called "Path Finding Visualizer" which shows Implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm which gives the shortest path in weighted graph with non negative weights . 
The goal of this project is to do all of these tasks while using some HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React Framework skills. The final output is a web application that allows any user to readily view and understand how the algorithms works. 


## Demo

## Features

 - User friendly interface with tutorial 
 - ary the postion of starting and ending node 
 - Add walls for blocking the node and add bombs for changing their weights 
 - Link to an article on Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm for better understanding

## Future Scope of Improvement

- Make it responsive
- Add more sorting algorithms to our project
- Run all the algorithms together for the same array to actually understand the time complexity.
- Vary speed when sorting is in process

## Tech Stack

**Client:** React,  HTML, CSS, JavaScript




## How to run?

Clone this repository into your system. 

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
